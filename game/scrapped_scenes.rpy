    scene bg university hallway

    "I walk back into the main university's hallway after leaving the gaming club."

    student "[mcname]! There you are! We've been texting you all day!"
    "I turn around and find two of the closest friends I've ever had, Lanie and Bryce, clutching their backpacks and tapping their feet."

    lanie "You skipped lunch, are you okay?"

    mc "Yeah! I had a meeting with Mrs. Richards."
    mc "She said I needed to add an extra-curricular to my resume, so I'm going between them all to see which one I like the most."

    bryce "A club? You?"
    bryce "We begged you to join the Debate Club for years! Why now?"

    mc "I wondered that too, but who am I to argue with a guidance counselor?"
    mc "Plus, if she really thinks it'll help my resume I figured it couldn't hurt to try."
    mc "I know it'll be hard to convince my dad..."

    lanie "He'll understand eventually. Wasn't he in a club too?"
    
    mc "He was in the soccer club, and mom in the string ensemble club."
    mc "I'm interested in both, plus maybe the gaming club."

    lanie "Gaming club? You do know who's the team captain, right?"

    bryce "Wait, we have a gaming club?"

    mc "Yeah, I was surprised too."
    mc "And I know Felix is the team captain, I just talked to him."
    mc "We're battling each other tomorrow."

    lanie "Oh, I bet he's really excited about that."

    "She nudges me with her elbow."

    mc "What's that supposed to mean?"

    # How does this even sort of make sense in light of the "I'm running a smear campaign and making everyone hate the MC"?
    lanie "Just that Felix's had a crush on you for over five years now."
    lanie "Or are you going to keep denying it?"

    mc "Felix definitely doesn't like me like that!"
    mc "If anything, it feels like he hates me."

    lanie "I'm sure."
    lanie "Anyway, we're almost late to our afternoon class."

    bryce "Call us back, okay?"
    bryce "We gotta talk about what we're doing for summer!"

    """
    We say our goodbyes, and I watch as they walk down the hallway together.
    Both Lanie and Bryce have been great friends since Lanie and I met Bryce freshman year of university. 
    They seem to have gotten closer to one another, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't sometimes feel left out.
    Hopefully our summer trip will help strengthen our bond before we all branch out to separate career fields. 
    I can't dwell too much on it, after all there's still a few things left to do today.
