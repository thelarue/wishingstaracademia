    "I enter the room to find the students all watching someone play in the center of the room."
    
    "I gasp."

    "It's Bastion, his head hanging over a solid oak violin as he plays a soft melody with skill and precision."

    "His hand glides back and forth and he slowly sways with the tempo."

    "There's a glow over his skin from sunlight that shines through the window, transforming him into a delicate, peaceful prince practicing a serenade for his princess."

    "I blush, what a weird thought."
    
    "Professor" "Isn't he amazing?"

    "A man about my father's age whispered to me."

    "Professor" "How can I help you, young lady?"
    
    mc "Oh, I came here to see about joining this class."
    
    sharp "I'm Professor Sharp and this is my class. There's exactly one spot open."

    mc "Could I have the syllabus, please?"

    But of course. 

    It'll be delightful to have you in my class. 

    You remind me of a dear friend...

    "This guy sounded very wistful, but I don't mind it."

    stop music 

    "The music started to die down as the students cheered for Bastion's playing. I couldn't help but clap as well."
    
    sharp "You can stay awhile and listen, if you'd like."

    "I took the syllabus in hand and shook my head."

    mc "No, but thank you, Professor Sharp."
