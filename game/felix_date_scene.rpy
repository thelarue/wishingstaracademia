    mc "There's a new KA game?"

    "Felix and I played the last release of Kingdom Archives together a few years ago."

    felix "I assume your card's locked until after mid-terms, right?"

    mc "How'd you know?"

    felix "Your dad locked it every year around this time in school."
    felix "Not surprising that he still does it."

    "He leans over me, and I try to remember the last time we were this close to each other physically."
    "He navigates through several menus and an online match-making screen shows."
    "After a few moments, a match is found and battle screen fades in." 
    "Two assassins face off from each other."
    "The controls feel familiar, but Felix still gives me helpful instructions as the match begins and I take control."

    mc "Hopefully it's the last year he locks it."

    "Felix sits next to me and watches as my match progress."

    mc "Next year, we'll both be at Rising Star Financial and managing our own finances."

    felix "Why does it sound like you're excited to be stuck with me in our post-grad career?"

    felix "Obsess much?"

    "I blush and wince a bit."

    mc "You know that's not what I meant."
    mc "I couldn't care less if you get a job at the same company as me."

    felix "Well, I guess I wouldn't mind it."

    "Despite my familiarity, I lose the first round miserably."
    "He chuckles, and I playfully shove his shoulder with my own."

    felix "I guess it'd be nice to see you more."

    "The next round starts, and both assassins are staring each other down."
    "Felix wasn't always this confusing."
    "But these days he's so hot and cold with me."
    "It's hard to tell if he actually likes me as a friend or hates me."
    "Or maybe something else entirely."

    felix "I haven't really made any friends since university started."
    felix "So it's been kind of boring."

    mc "But I always see you walking with a group of people. I thought they were your friends?"

    felix "I don't even know half of their names."
    felix "And they definitely don't know mine."

    "I grin just as I win the second round."

    mc "You mean Eugene?"

    felix "Don't say it so loud!"
    felix "Someone else might hear you!"

    "Before long, I've started a new match, my assassin is standing across from a warrior."

    mc "Sorry, sorry."
    mc "I didn't mean to say it like that."
    mc "But if they really don't know your name is Felix, why don't you tell just tell them?"

    "The round begins and there's a silence between us hanging in the air."
    "The match ends in another loss, and I've still not heard a peep from Felix."
    "I can feel time starting pass faster, and I keep playing more matches."

    "Felix breaks the silence suddenly."

    felix "Making friends just seems worthless these days."
    felix "None of them have any advantages for me."
    felix "And they don't even play games, so there's almost nothing for us to even talk about."

    mc "Well, I know in school we have to be competitive."
    mc "But maybe after school we can play some co-op games together again."
    mc "I kinda miss it."

    "For the first time, I finally see a small blush creep over Felix's cheeks."

    felix "Sure!"
    felix "I mean, I guess..."
    felix "If you really wanted to."
    felix "I am really busy these days but I can probably make some time for you."

    mc "Lucky me."
    "He can be such a tsundere sometimes."
    "I glance at the time on my phone, realizing how late it is."

    felix "You should get home before your dad gets mad like he alway does."
    "Back then, I'd stay at Felix's house late into the night, playing games."

    "I raise my eyes away from the screen and tilt my head, making a show of thinking."

    mc "I can probably stay a bit longer."

    "I shoot my eyes in his direction with a smile for a moment, before focusing back on the game."

    "I guess he still doesn't have anyone at home waiting up for him."
    "His mom passed away when we were in high school, and his dad was always absent on some work trip in a distant city."
    
    felix "Thanks, but I'm fine."
    felix "Almost done with the latest Tech-Mech 6 game."

    mc "Oh, I heard that was a good one."
    mc "You should tell me about it next time."

    felix "On our next date?"

    "Whoa. Wait."

    mc "That's not what I meant."

    felix "Sure, [mcname]."
    felix "Keep telling yourself that."
